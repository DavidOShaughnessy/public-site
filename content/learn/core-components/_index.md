# The 5 Core Components of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP)

An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) should be built to cover 5 Core Components. This section explains all of these components in detail. The 5 Core Components are:

**Core Component** | **Short Description**
--- | ---
[**Application Configuration Management**]({{< relref "application-configuration-management" >}}) | Manage application configuration in a dynamic, scalable and reliable way.
[**Infrastructure Orchestration**]({{< relref "infrastructure-orchestration" >}}) | Orchestrate your infrastructure in a dynamic and intelligent way depending on the context.
[**Environment Management**]({{< relref "environment-management" >}}) | Enable developers to create new and fully provisioned environments whenever needed.
[**Deployment Management**]({{< relref "deployment-management" >}}) | Implement a delivery pipeline for Continuous Delivery or even Continuous Deployment (CD). 
[**Role-Based Access Control**]({{< relref "role-based-access-control" >}}) | Manage who can do what in a scalable way.
