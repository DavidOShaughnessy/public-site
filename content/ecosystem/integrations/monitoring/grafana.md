# Grafana

Grafana is an open source technology used to compose observability dashboards with everything from Prometheus and Graphite metrics, to logs and application data to power plants and beehives.

Grafana connects with a plethora of databases including Graphite, Prometheus, Influx DB, ElasticSearch, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It helps to monitor and analyze data and track user and application behavior including error type and frequency in pre-production and production-environments. 

 If you're ok with the additional overhead it's a great way to monitor.
