# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open source monitoring platform. Built primarily for monitoring containerized workloads, Prometheus is a popular tool for collecting time series data from instrumented jobs using an open, vendor-neutral, text-based exposition format. 

It records real-time metrics in a time series database (allowing for high [dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_%28metadata%29)) built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting. The project is written in Go and licensed under the Apache 2 License, with [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) available on GitHub, and is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
