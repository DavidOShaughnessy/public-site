# Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry allows you to build, store, and manage container images and artifacts in a private registry for all types of container deployments. It handles private Docker container images as well as related content formats, such as Helm charts, Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts, and images built to the OCI image format specification.
