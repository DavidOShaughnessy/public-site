# RabbitMQ

****RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.

RabbitMQ is lightweight and easy to deploy on-premises and in the cloud. RabbitMQ can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.
