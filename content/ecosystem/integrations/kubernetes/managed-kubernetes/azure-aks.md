# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**AKS** **is** a container orchestration **service** that helps you to manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications in seconds in a cluster environment on **Azure**.

**Azure** **Kubernetes** **service** has been available on the Microsoft **Azure** platform since June 2018 making it a latecomer to the game of Kubernetes. However, it is increasing in functionality and technically, and operationally sufficient. We consider it ok, but not top of the list.
