# OpenShift

OpenShift is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated operations to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. Its advantages include that the API is well documented and governed by design and it helps you enforce security standards. However, it's a beast in terms of complexity, make sure you have lots of time for set up and maintenance.
