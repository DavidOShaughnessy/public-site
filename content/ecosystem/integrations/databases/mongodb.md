# MongoDB

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built-in and easy to use.
