# Aiven Database-as-a-Service

Aiven provides managed, cloud-based services designed to make it easier for businesses to build services on top of open source project.

Aiven database-as-a-service enables you to accelerate application innovation through a modern, fully-managed open source data infrastructure immediately deployable in public clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. 

Aiven comes highly recommended because the product provides a single, well documented, and easy to manage API that spans several different types of databases at once (Cassandra, Kafka, Postgres, InfluxDB, Elastic, Redis, Grafana, and more). This makes it much easier to manage, and maintain.
