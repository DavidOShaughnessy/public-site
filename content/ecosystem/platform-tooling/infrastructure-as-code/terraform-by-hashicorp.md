# Terraform by Hashicorp

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code software tool that provides a consistent CLI (Command Line Interface) workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. This allows you to automate the provisioning of your infrastructure resources. It's the perfect way to build the provisioning-component of the infrastructure orchestration building block yourself.
