# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

It's a competitive attack by AWS against Google: it offers great availability and is technically close to GKE. However, it's downsides are a draining permissions model and a high level of complexity that will take a while to digest.
