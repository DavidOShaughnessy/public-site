# Elastic

Elastic is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene and developed in Java. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. It is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence use cases.

Elastic is easy to implement. You can quickly add pre-tuned searches to your website, app, or eCommerce store.
