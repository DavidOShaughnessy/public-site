# Jenkins

Jenkins is the leading open source automation server, providing hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating. Jenkins is often used to orchestrate the scripts and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setups that power an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). However, it has a tendency to get very difficult to maintain. While IDPs build with Jenkins scale to a certain degree, they require a large amount of maintenance.
