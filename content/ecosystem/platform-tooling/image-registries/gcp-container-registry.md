# Container Registry \| Google Cloud

Container Registry is a single place for your team to manage Docker images, perform vulnerability analysis, and decide who can access what with fine-grained access control. Existing Continuous Integration, Continous Delivery, and Deployment (referred to as CI/CD) integrations let you set up fully automated Docker pipelines to get fast feedback.

***NOTE : Container Registry is still available and will continue to be supported as a [Google Enterprise API](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis), going forward new features will only be available in Artifact Registry, and Container Registry will only receive critical security fixes.***
