# Container Registry \| Google Cloud

Container Registry is a single place for your team to manage Docker images, perform vulnerability analysis, and decide who can access what with fine-grained access control. Existing Continuous Integration, Continous Delivery, and Deployment (referred to as CI/CD) integrations let you set up fully automated Docker pipelines to get fast feedback.
