# Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, share, and deploy your container images and artifacts anywhere. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. Your images are hosts your images in a high-performance architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy images for your container applications.
