# Jenkins

Jenkins is the leading open source automation server, providing hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating. Jenkins is often used to orchestrate the scripts and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setups to power an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). However, Jenkins has a tendency to become very hard to maintain. While IDPs built with Jenkins scale to a certain degree, they require significant maintenance.
